## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Fine granularity (12 phases) derived from 174 requirements across 20 categories
- [Roadmap]: Phases 7, 8, 10 can parallelize after Phase 4; Phase 9 requires 7+8; Phase 11 requires 7+8+9
- [01-01]: Combined auth.org_id() into 00004_rls_policies.sql for migration ordering; kept 00006 as reference
- [01-01]: Used getClaims() with null coalesce for safe JWT claim extraction in middleware
- [01-02]: Changed Database types from interface to type alias for Supabase postgrest generic compatibility
- [01-02]: Used z.input for form types where schema has .default() to avoid zodResolver mismatch
- [01-03]: Used /driver prefix instead of (driver) route group to avoid Next.js parallel page resolution conflict
- [01-03]: Extracted determineRoute() as pure function for testable routing logic
- [01-03]: Made supabaseAdmin lazy via Proxy to avoid build-time env var initialization crash

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- REQUIREMENTS.md states 148 v1 requirements but actual count is 174. Traceability table updated with correct count.
